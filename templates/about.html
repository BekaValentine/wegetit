  <h1>WeGetIt</h1>

  <p>
    WeGetIt is an experimental communication platform that strives for shared
    understanding above all else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than providing a means for completely unrestricted conversations,
    which are prone to devolving into flame wars and pointless hate, WeGetIt
    structures conversations around understanding one another's meanings.
  </p>

  <h2>How It Works</h2>

  <p>
    Below is a list of "threads". Each is a structured conversation, with a
    name describing it, and a brief detailed overview of the topic under
    discussion in that thread. You can create a new thread by clicking the
    text <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Thread</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within each thread, there are "perspectives", which present a fellow
    user's way of understanding a word or term of their choosing. Each
    perspective consists of the word or term, together with the user's
    personal interpretation of what it means, in their own words. You can add
    your own perspectives on whatever word you want by clicking the text
    <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Perspective</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Within each perspective, there are "paraphrases", which are other users
    rewording of the original user's personal interpretation. These
    paraphrases are supposed to be mere restatements of the original meaning
    in the perspective. A good way to write a paraphrase would begin with
    something like "I understand you as saying ...". You can add your own
    paraphrase on a perspective by clicking the text
    <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Paraphrase</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each paraphrase can be rated by the original author of the perspective
    that's being paraphrased. The ratings are either "Not Quite", which
    indicates that the paraphrase isn't exactly what the original author
    meant, or "We Get It!", which means that the original author things that
    the paraphrase is a good paraphrase of their meaning. These ratings will
    show up next to the paraphrases once they are given by the original
    author.
  </p>

  <p>
    All parts of this are anonymous and unlinked. A browser cookie is used to
    allow you to be identified to the server as the author of particular
    threads, perspectives, and paraphrases, but no login or username is
    required, and if you clear your browser cookies, the server will no longer
    know who you are.  These conversations are meant to be anonymous, and we
    don't want people to fight with one another offline over the particular
    meanings or paraphrases. Rather, we want people to understand each other,
    first and foremost.
  </p>

  <h2>Origins</h2>

  <p>
    WeGetIt is a program originally envisioned in Karl Schroeder's short story
    <em>Degrees of Freedom</em>, in the <em>Hieroglyph</em> anthology. It's
    intended to form an integral part of a future political system that is
    more just and fair. It fits in well with the general theme of Hieroglyph
    as a collection of science fiction stories that inspire people to work on
    and build a better tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    We build WeGetIt precisely because we yearn to build a better tomorrow,
    and were inspired by Schroeder's story. We don't know if WeGetIt can, or
    will, have the same importance in the real world as it did in his story,
    but we believe that it's important to explore and experiment with these
    things. If no one builds the better tomorrow, then we can't expect it to
    arrive.

  <h2>Copyright Info</h2>

  <p>
    We want people to build and expand on this, so we offer WeGetIt to the
    world as free software, licensed under AGPLv3.
