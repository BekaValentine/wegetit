      <h1>WeGetIt</h1>

      <p>
        WeGetIt is an experimental communication platform that strives for shared
        understanding above all else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than providing a means for completely unrestricted conversations,
        which are prone to devolving into flame wars and pointless hate, WeGetIt
        structures conversations around understanding one another's meanings.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <p>
        Below is a list of "threads". Each is a structured conversation, with a
        name describing it, and a brief detailed overview of the topic under
        discussion in that thread. You can create a new thread by clicking the
        text <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Thread</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each thread, there are "perspectives", which present a fellow
        user's way of understanding a word or term of their choosing. Each
        perspective consists of the word or term, together with the user's
        personal interpretation of what it means, in their own words. You can add
        your own perspectives on whatever word you want by clicking the text
        <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Perspective</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within each perspective, there are "paraphrases", which are other users
        rewording of the original user's personal interpretation. These
        paraphrases are supposed to be mere restatements of the original meaning
        in the perspective. A good way to write a paraphrase would begin with
        something like "I understand you as saying ...". You can add your own
        paraphrase on a perspective by clicking the text
        <code>+&nbsp;New&nbsp;Paraphrase</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each paraphrase can be rated by the original author of the perspective
        that's being paraphrased. The ratings are either "Not Quite", which
        indicates that the paraphrase isn't exactly what the original author
        meant, or "We Get It!", which means that the original author things that
        the paraphrase is a good paraphrase of their meaning. These ratings will
        show up next to the paraphrases once they are given by the original
        author.
      </p>

      <p>
        All parts of this are anonymous and unlinked. A browser cookie is used to
        allow you to be identified to the server as the author of particular
        threads, perspectives, and paraphrases, but no login or username is
        required, and if you clear your browser cookies, the server will no longer
        know who you are.  These conversations are meant to be anonymous, and we
        don't want people to fight with one another offline over the particular
        meanings or paraphrases. Rather, we want people to understand each other,
        first and foremost.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins</h2>

      <p>
        WeGetIt is a program originally envisioned in Karl Schroeder's short story
        <em>Degrees of Freedom</em>, in the <em>Hieroglyph</em> anthology. It's
        intended to form an integral part of a future political system that is
        more just and fair. It fits in well with the general theme of Hieroglyph
        as a collection of science fiction stories that inspire people to work on
        and build a better tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        We build WeGetIt precisely because we yearn to build a better tomorrow,
        and were inspired by Schroeder's story. We don't know if WeGetIt can, or
        will, have the same importance in the real world as it did in his story,
        but we believe that it's important to explore and experiment with these
        things. If no one builds the better tomorrow, then we can't expect it to
        arrive.
      </p>

      <h2>Copyright Info</h2>

      <p>
        We want people to build and expand on this, so we offer WeGetIt to the
        world as free software, licensed under AGPLv3.
      </p>
