# wegetit

An implementation of WeGetIt from Karl Schroeder's short story Degrees of Freedom

## terminology

For lack of better terms, "definitions" describes the term-definition-paraphrase portions of WeGetIt, while "conversations" describes the broad collection of definitions.

## pages/flows

- Main Page
  - Overview/description of WeGetIt
  - List of conversations you've created
  - List of conversations you've joined
- My Conversations Page
  - Convo ID + Description --click--> Manager for this convo
  - Create New Convo button
- Manage Convo
  - Overview of what the conversation is about
  - List of definitions in this conversation --click--> view definition
- View Definition
  - Term
  - Initial definition
  - Paraphrases + good/bad judgment

## considerations

- ease of setup - no signup required
- privacy/anonymity
- ability to return to conversations/connect up multiple convos?
- how to have more feedback beyond just "we get it!", without it devolving into arguments?
  - idea: maybe let the definer highlight some parts of the definition and explicitly mark those as not what they mean?
